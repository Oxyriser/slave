Minimalistic but yet powerful prompt for fish shell.

## Features

Slave is really light and shows informations only when you **need** to see
them. Slave should be able to run on any font or color configuration.

## Installation

You can install Slave with [Fisherman](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman).

Slave is just a bunch of fish prompt functions so it can also be installed
manually.
